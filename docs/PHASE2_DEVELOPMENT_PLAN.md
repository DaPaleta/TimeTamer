# Phase 2 Development Plan: Rules and Validations Engine

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Phase:** 2 of 4  
**Duration:** 4 weeks (Weeks 5-8)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 of the Task Planning Application, focusing on the development of the intelligent scheduling rules engine and validation system. The goal is to transform the application from a basic task manager into a smart productivity tool with environment-aware scheduling and intelligent suggestions.

## Current State Analysis ✅

### Existing Infrastructure

- **Database Schema**: `SchedulingRule` model already exists in `models.py` (lines 197-220)
- **API Structure**: FastAPI with versioned routes (`/api/v1/`) already set up
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system in place
- **Testing**: Basic test framework with pytest configured
- **Services**: Basic service structure exists (`day_context.py`)

### Phase 1 Completed Features

- Basic task CRUD operations with full API coverage
- Calendar day configuration with environment and focus time settings
- Simple validation logic (environment mismatch, focus time, availability)
- Frontend calendar with drag-and-drop functionality
- User authentication and profile management
- Category management system

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 5-6: Backend Scheduling Engine Core

#### 1. Create Scheduling Schemas (`backend/app/schemas/scheduling.py`)

**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Effort: 1 day**

**Deliverables:**

- Pydantic models for validation requests/responses
- Rule CRUD schemas with proper validation
- Suggestion and rule evaluation schemas
- Type-safe interfaces for all scheduling operations

**Key Models:**

```python
class ValidationResult(BaseModel):
    is_valid: bool
    validation_result: str  # "allowed|blocked|warned"
    warnings: List[str]
    block_reasons: List[str]
    suggestions: List[SuggestionSlot]
    rule_evaluations: List[RuleEvaluationResult]

class SuggestionSlot(BaseModel):
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: datetime
    score: float  # 0.0-1.0
    reason: str
    calendar_day_id: Optional[str]

class SchedulingRuleCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str]
    conditions: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    action: str  # "allow|block|warn|suggest_alternative"
    alert_message: Optional[str]
    priority_order: int = 100
    is_active: bool = True
```

#### 2. Implement Scheduling Engine Service (`backend/app/services/scheduling_engine.py`)

**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Effort: 3 days**

**Core Methods:**

```python
class SchedulingEngine:
    def validate_placement(self, task_id, start_time, end_time, user_id) -> ValidationResult
    def suggest_slots(self, task_id, date_range, user_id) -> List[SuggestionSlot]
    def evaluate_rules(self, task, calendar_day, proposed_slot) -> RuleEvaluationResult
    def auto_schedule_tasks(self, task_ids, date_range, user_id) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

**Key Features:**

- Rule evaluation with priority ordering (lowest number = highest priority)
- Conflict detection (time overlaps, environment mismatches, focus requirements)
- Optimization scoring (priority + deadline + focus time alignment + environment fit)
- Constraint satisfaction (environment, focus requirements, availability)
- Suggestion ranking based on multiple factors

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Rule Evaluation Engine**: Parse and evaluate JSON conditions against task and calendar context
2. **Conflict Detection**: Check for time overlaps, environment mismatches, and constraint violations
3. **Scoring Algorithm**: Calculate slot suitability scores (0.0-1.0) based on multiple factors
4. **Suggestion Generation**: Find optimal slots within date range with fallback options

#### 3. Create Scheduling API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/scheduling.py`)

**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Effort: 2 days**

**Endpoints:**

```yaml
# Validation & Suggestions
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/validate
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/suggest
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/auto-schedule

# Scheduling Rules CRUD
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/rules
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/rules
PUT    /api/v1/scheduling/rules/{rule_id}
DELETE /api/v1/scheduling/rules/{rule_id}
```

**API Response Examples:**

```json
// Validation Response
{
  "is_valid": true,
  "validation_result": "allowed",
  "warnings": ["Task requires focus but scheduled outside focus time"],
  "block_reasons": [],
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "start_time": "2025-05-28T09:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2025-05-28T10:30Z",
      "score": 0.9,
      "reason": "Matches focus time and work environment"
    }
  ],
  "rule_evaluations": [
    {
      "rule_id": "uuid",
      "rule_name": "Block urgent tasks outside focus",
      "action": "warn",
      "triggered": true,
      "message": "Urgent tasks should be scheduled during focus time",
      "severity": "warning"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Update Router Configuration (`backend/app/api/v1/router.py`)

**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Effort: 0.5 day**

**Changes:**

- Include the new scheduling router in the main API router
- Ensure proper route prefixing and versioning

### Week 7: Frontend Integration

#### 1. Create Scheduling API Client (`frontend/src/api/scheduling.ts`)

**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Effort: 1 day**

**Features:**

- TypeScript interfaces for all scheduling types
- API client functions for validation, suggestions, and rules
- Error handling and type safety
- Integration with existing API client utilities

#### 2. Enhance Calendar Validation (`frontend/src/pages/calendar/Calendar.tsx`)

**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Effort: 2 days**

**Enhancements:**

- Real-time validation during drag-and-drop operations
- Smart suggestion display when validation fails
- Warning system for rule violations
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Integration with existing calendar event handling

**Key Features:**

- End-to-end validation flow tests

## Technical Architecture

### Scheduling Engine Design

```python
class SchedulingEngine:
    def __init__(self, db: Session):
        self.db = db

    def validate_placement(self, task_id, start_time, end_time, user_id) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate if a task can be scheduled at the proposed time"""

    def suggest_slots(self, task_id, date_range, user_id) -> List[SuggestionSlot]:
        """Find optimal scheduling slots for a task"""

    def evaluate_rules(self, task, calendar_day, proposed_slot) -> RuleEvaluationResult:
        """Evaluate all applicable scheduling rules"""

    def auto_schedule_tasks(self, task_ids, date_range, user_id) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Automatically schedule multiple tasks optimally"""
```

### Rule Evaluation Strategy

- **Priority-based Ordering**: Rules evaluated by priority_order (lowest = highest priority)
- **JSON Condition Parsing**: Flexible condition system with multiple data sources
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear reasoning for rule violations
- **Scoring Algorithm**: 0.0-1.0 scoring for suggestions based on multiple factors

### Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexing**: Indexes on frequently queried fields (user_id, priority_order, is_active)
- **Caching**: Cache rule evaluation results for frequently accessed rules
- **Rate Limiting**: Request rate limiting for validation endpoints
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized queries for calendar day lookups
